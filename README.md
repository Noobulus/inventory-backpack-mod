## About
This mod adds backpacks that can be accessed from inventory.

### Origins
It's based on forge mod [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), or more specifically it was heavily inspirited by it; when it was rewritten from the ground up specially for fabric. Generally it is a port of it in some way, because from the gameplay side it only adds some small changes.
